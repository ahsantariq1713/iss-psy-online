    Dear Therapist,<br><br>
    Welcome to Psychologists Online and please see below a few recommendations and terms and conditions that you should be familiar with, to make your experience in using the platform more enjoyable and productive.<br><br>

    Psychologists Online was developed to allow Therapists and Patients from around the world to connect in a safe, affordable, and professional manner.
    We strive to provide the highest level of security regarding qualifications and professional experience, cross checking data and certificates, guaranteeing the integrity and credibility of the platform, which is the core of our model.<br><br>

    We connect thousands of patients and therapists from all over the world, reason why we would like to make a few suggestions for your convenience.<br><br>
</p>


<ul class="lead">
    <li>
        Please set your hourly consultation fees at a price that matches the average of the country you are based at, in US Dollars and according to your experience and qualifications.<br><br>

For instance:  If you are based in Germany, please set your consultation fee calculated according to what a therapist in Germany, who has the same level of experience and qualifications as you do, would charge by the hour in Germany; That way you can guarantee you will receive the highest interest from clients and grow in recurring patients without under-pricing yourself or others, keeping the platform, your reputation, and ratings at the highest level.<br><br>
    </li>
<li>Make sure you describe in detail your areas of expertise, work experience, languages you speak, and others a potential Patient would consider relevant, to attract the clients you would like to work with.<br><br>
</li>

<li>Also, we recommend you creating a video on youtube.com so you can attach it to your profile (area available within your profile) so your potential clients can connect with you in a more personal manner, potentially making them feel more comfortable with who you are, generating more bookings.<br><br>
</li>

<li>Please remember that Psychologists Online focuses in providing quality practitioners at affordable prices so setting a fee that is competitive, will increase your chances of being fully booked on a regular basis, while working from the comfort of your practice or even home, saving you from practice related expenses, translating into more money in your pocket.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
Please note that the appointments are set by the hour with intervals to allow you to have a break or organize your next consultations.
Due to this, we implemented a timer at the bottom of your video window that will be counting down. Once the time gets closer to “zero” time left, you will receive several ringtone notifications, alerting you that your meeting is about to end, and that it will automatically terminate the consultation when the time is up.<br>
We have added this feature to protect your time and avoid having clients abusing the system, creating an overlapping of appointments, and disrupting the therapist’s schedule.<br><br>


Also note that the system allows you 24 hrs after the consultation is completed, to send recommendations to your patient if you required so, offering another layer of customer service for you and your client.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Another of the benefits of our platform is that you will not have to advertise, pay for Zoom or Skype fees, collect payments, deal with painful connection issues due to yours or the patients’ lack of technical knowledge, time zone confusion, or even deal with third parties to book your patients as we do all that for you. All you need to do is present your profile the best you can, wait for bookings to be locked in, and be ready to meet your patient as confirmed. It is that simple!<br><br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">
    <strong><u> Please note the following booking terms and conditions:</u>
    </strong>
</p>

<ol class="lead">
    <li>Before you commence your appointment with your patient, you must ensure your internet, webcam and microphone are working properly.<br><br></li>

    <li>If the patient cancels at any time, you will still be paid in full (minus psychologists-online.com commission).<br><br></li>

    <li>If your booking is due after 48hrs from the session time, you will be able to cancel it, or re-book it, by agreeing and arranging a more convenient time for you and your
        patient,
        without
        any
        cancellation fees applied to you or your patient.<br><br>
    </li>

    <li>In the event you cancel or miss the appointment within the 48hr period, you will be charged a $10usd cancellations/booking fee.<br><br></li>

    <li>Consequently, you might have clients that booked a session before those 48hrs period. For that purpose, if you require to cancel due to unforeseen circumstances, you will
        need to email
        us at
        support@psychologists-online.com so we can look into alternatives to prevent having an unhappy client.<br><br>
    </li>
</ol>

<p class="lead">
    Even though we understand that sometimes things out of our control happen, we recommend you complying with your booking as diligently as you can, as if there is a cancellation without notice, the patient might leave a bad review on your profile, affecting your scoring and our reputation.<br><br>
    We sincerely hope that you find our platform with the value to be a recurrent client, reminding you that if you had any questions or suggestions our support team is always available to diligently help.<br><br>
    Thank you again and welcome to Psychologists Online
