    Dear Patient,<br>
    Welcome to Psychologists Online and please see below a few recommendations to make your experience in using our platform more enjoyable.<br><br>
    Psychologists Online has been developed to allow Therapists and Patients from around the world to connect in a safe, affordable, and professional manner.<br><br>
    We strive to provide the highest level of security regarding qualifications and professional experience, cross checking data and certificates, guaranteeing the integrity and credibility of the platform.<br>
    We connect thousands of patients and therapists from all over the world, for which we would like to make a few suggestions for your convenience.<br><br>
</p>


<ul class="lead">
    <li>Please select your Therapist considering their areas of expertise that match your needs, experience, language, star ratings, or cultural background that better suit your needs.<br><br>
    </li>

    <li>You will notice that prices vary due to their qualifications, expertise, location, and country’s average fee parameters, so please consider those before making your selection, so you can get the best value for your consultation.<br><br>
    </li>

    <li>
        Before you commence your video appointment with your Therapist, you must ensure your internet, webcam and microphone are working properly.<br><br>
        Please note that cancellations made by patients are no refundable unless the cancellation is created by the Therapist. If that occurs, you will receive a full refund within the following 5 to 7 days of the “cancellation ticket” being created by the doctor.<br>
    We implemented this to avoid having fake accounts being created, guaranteeing that all consultations are booked and secured for the best interest of patients and therapists.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>The platform recognizes your location, so you do not have to choose your time zone as Psychologists Online artificial intelligence will automatically adapt the therapists’ available hours to yours, minimizing time zone confusion or missing appointments.<br><br>
        Example: The doctor has available appointments at 10:00 Am in Pakistan and it will display on your screen on your time zone, which could be 3:00 Pm if you are in Australia or others, depending where you are located around the world. Simple!<br><br>
    </li>

    <li>Psychologists Online has integrated all the latest features available on the market such as video conferencing, cross checked qualification validation for therapists, text message and email account verification, email and text message reminders, and links to allow you access to your dashboard no matter where you are, from your mobile phone or personal computer.<br><br>
        Please note that as you booked an appointment by the hour, you will be allowed to interact with your therapist during that hour only, and that when the hour is completed, the system will automatically terminate the meeting. We implemented this to avoid having meetings overlapping each other.
        <br><br>
        Having said that, you do not have to worry about having a meeting shutting down without notice! You will be conveniently notified by a ringtone several times before the timer at the bottom of your video window reaches the “zero” time left, so you can schedule another appointment or to make final questions at your convenience.<br><br>
    Consequently, and after the completion of your meeting, your therapist will also have 24 hrs to send you recommendations if he had any, or requirements he might find relevant for following consultations.<br><br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">
    We sincerely hope that you find our platform with the value to be a recurrent client, reminding you that if you had any questions or suggestions our support team is always available to diligently help.<br><br>
    Thank you again and welcome to Psychologists Online
