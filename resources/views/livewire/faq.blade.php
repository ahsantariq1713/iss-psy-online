                        <p>Simply sign up on our platform or look for the condition you consider you suffer from or have been previously diagnosed with by scrolling on our search bar. That will prompt you to all the available therapists that match your criteria.
                            You can now narrow your search to fit your needs by language, review ratings and others.
                            Select your preferred therapist and book a consultation according to the available calendar displayed on the therapist’s profile. That calendar matches your time zone, so you don’t have to worry about missing an appointment.<br>
                            Pay securely for your consultation. Be ready to meet your counsellor or therapist on the date of the appointment by video call. That simple!

                    <div id="collapse2" class="collapse">
                        <p>The cost per consultation depends on each therapist and varies depending on location, current country’s average therapist’s rates and their level of experience or qualifications.
                            There are no hidden fees and the price displayed on the therapist’s portal is the price you will be charged upon completion of the counselling session.<br>
                            Example: If the consultation says $50 per hour, that is what you will be charged if the consultation extends to 1 hr. All prices are set in US Dollars.

                        <p>No, you do not need to be a computer guru. All you need to do is to follow the prompts and complete as required, providing personal details in order to be able to confirm who you are and how we can help, and the platform will do the rest. <br>
                            You do not need a camera either if you do not have one, you can still be connected with audio only if necessary, or in the event you prefer to be anonymous during your consultation.<br>
                            You will not need to sign up on external sources of audio or video communication either (Zoom, Skype, etc), making it super simple, more affordable, and convenient for clients and therapists alike.

                            If you decide once that period has expired, you will not be entitled to a refund.<br>
                            You can also get a full refund if your therapist decides to cancel your appointment for any reason. We will give you the option of rebooking with another practitioner or a full refund. The choice is yours.
